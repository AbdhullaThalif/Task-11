Checked Exception :

     * Checked exceptions occur at compile time. 
     * The compiler checks a checked exception.
     * These types of exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.
     * They are the sub-class of the exception class. Needs the exception to catch and handle.

UnChecked Exception :

     * Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime.
     * The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
     * These types of exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation, because they get generated by the mistakes in the program.
     * They are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class. Does not require the exception to catch and handle.
